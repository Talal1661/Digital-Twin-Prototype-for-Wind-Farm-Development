# Digital-Twin-Prototype-for-Wind-Farm-Development
Digital twin is one of the fastest growing technological trends in Industry 4.0. It enables the industries to monitor the assets in real-time, predict their remaining lifetime, and even to test and validate the assets without having actually built them. This emerging technology has made it easy to research and test other technologies with minimum effort and cost to get maximum efficiency out of it. 
Wind power is the most important source of renewable energy. It has become one of the most established and efficient renewable energy sources that became very popular over the last few decades due to being environment-friendly in nature. This project provides the platform using Unity 3D where a digital twin can be tested using a case study of a Hywind Tampen floating wind farm which can pave the way for the researchers to work and analyze the complete project without working to get an actual prototype. We generated few scenarios, where a user can change wind speed and direction to monitor power generation, using random data generation through Unity, and using actual weather condition of Gulfak region.
